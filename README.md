# Google Cloud Platform Playground

Me just messing around with GCP and various things.

Goal:

+ Make sure I have some kind of _personal_ reference for building and using
  GCP so that, should I leave Google, I can do similar things from scratch.

Items:

+ [ ] IAM: Create some kind of service account for code to upload things to GCP.
+ [ ] Cloud logging is a big one.
+ [ ] Upload to GCS
+ [ ] PubSub GCS & Cloud Functions
+ [ ] Cloud Function: trigger on GCS file, write data to database.
+ [ ] Perhaps upload to Drive
+ [ ] Protobuf

Perhaps do most of the above with Terraform, too. Partially to learn TF, partially
so that I can tear down everything and not get billed ðŸ˜‰.
